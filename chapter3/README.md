- `receive buffer`: A receive buffer is block of memory that stores incoming data from a network interface card (NIC). It allows the node to accept certain amount of data without requiring an application to read the data immediately. We have per-connection receive buffer. When in our `Go Code` we call `Read` from `net.Conn` interface, it will read data from the receive buffer.

- `window size` : The window size is the maximum amount of data that can be sent without receiving an acknowledgment. It is a measure of the sender's buffer size and the receiver's buffer size. The window size is used to control the flow of data between the sender and receiver. A window size of `0` means the receiver's buffer is full and the sender should wait for an acknowledgment before sending more data. Each server and client has a window size.
