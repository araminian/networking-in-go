/*
This code could have a security vulnerability since part of the response
body might come from the request body. A malicious client can send a
request payload that includes JavaScript, which could run on a clientâ€™s
computer. This behavior can lead to an XSS attack.

To prevent these attacks, you must properly escape all client-supplied content
before sending it in a response. Here, you use the html/template package
to create a simple template that reads Hello, {{.}}!, where {{.}} is a
placeholder for part of your response. Templates derived from the html/template
package automatically escape HTML characters when you populate them and
write the results to the response writer
